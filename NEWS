Chages in 0.0.2
  * BUG FIX: A source file from the FIT SDK assumed a C++11-compatible compiler.
    Hence, C++11 is now listed in the package description file as a system
    requirement.
  * Cleaned bike data now has a "start_time" attribute (if possible),
    facilitated by the fact that all importing functions now consistently
    try to append a "timestamp.posix" column.
  * Post-import processing functions (`clean_bikedata` and `uniform_sampling`)
    now better preserve the attributes of their inputs.

Changes in 0.0.1
	* First official version; released on CRAN.
