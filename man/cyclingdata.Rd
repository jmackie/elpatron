\description{
Two example cycling datasets are included with the
  \code{elpatron} package. The first (\code{lufbra}) is a short and simple
  spin around Loughborough University's fine campus. This file has also been
  reformatted to .tcx and .gpx formats, both of which are included (along
  with the original .fit file) in this package's extdata directory. The
  second dataset is from a far more aggressive chaingang with two other
  fellow Loughborough cyclists.

\section{Creation}{

These data were generated via the following: \preformatted{
f <- system.file("extdata/lufbra.fit", package = "elpatron")
lufbra <- f \%>\% import_ride \%>\% clean_bikedata

f <- system.file("extdata/chaingang.fit", package = "elpatron")
chaingang <- f \%>\% import_ride \%>\% clean_bikedata
}
