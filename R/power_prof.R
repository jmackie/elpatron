#' Cycling power profiling
#'
#' @description Generates best powers for a range of time intervals given
#'   vectors of power (Watts) and time (seconds).
#'
#' @details In the interest of efficiency, this function returns a power profile
#'   for which time windows are not known exactly \emph{a priori}. As data can
#'   be, and often are, sampled with inconsistencies, deriving best powers for
#'   known durations is computationally expensive. However, absent any
#'   inconsistencies (e.g. breaks in the data), the returned time windows will
#'   be of duration: \code{windows / sampling_frequency}. Hence, the default
#'   range for the profile should be roughly 2 to 30 minutes (in 10 second
#'   increments) assuming 1 Hz sampling.
#'
#'   If there \emph{are} large breaks in the data, specious values might be
#'   returned. This because head unit devices will record a power value when
#'   recording is resumed after a pause, and this power value will thus be
#'   associated with a large delta time value. In effect, the power value logged
#'   when recording is resumed will be treated as the \emph{mean} power output
#'   for that entire break. With obvious implications. If such a situation is
#'   encountered, this function will throw a warning if \code{quietly = FALSE}.
#'
#' @param power.W,time.s numeric vectors (of equal length) describing power
#'   readings in Watts and the times at which they were recorded (in seconds).
#' @param windows numeric; window(s) over which to derive best powers. If data
#'   are sampled consistently at 1 Hz, these effectively correspond to time
#'   windows in units of seconds. Hence, assuming 1 Hz sampling, the default is
#'   2-30 minutes in 10 second increments.
#' @param quietly logical; should warning messages be suppressed?
#'
#' @return A \code{\link[dplyr]{tbl_df}} with two columns: a vector of time
#'   windows and a vector of corresponding maximal mean powers.
