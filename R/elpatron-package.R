#' elpatron: improved cycling data analysis
#'
#' \code{elpatron} is a package intended to facilitate analysis of bicycling
#' data within the R environment.
#'
#' \code{elpatron} supercedes the \code{cycleRtools} package, if only for having
#' a cooler name. Generally speaking, this package attempts to do much less than
#' cycleRtools. But what it does, it does much better. File reading functions
#' are now much more efficient; raw data is left largely untouched by default;
#' and certain assumptions that had to be made for more \emph{involved} routines
#' are now left to the user to explicitly resolve. Generally speaking, the best
#' bits of cycleRtools have been skimmed and improved.
#'
#' This package came with the realisation that the advantage of using R is not
#' convenience \emph{per se}, but rather its attendant freedom and flexibility.
#' Hence, rather than provide menial functions for common analysis routines,
#' this package simply aims to be \emph{facilitative}.
#'
#' The package is also intended to work seamlessly with those of Hadley Wickham
#' \emph{et al.} (notably \code{dplyr} and \code{purrr}).

# ------------------------------------------
# Notes to self:
#
# + pugixml needs to be in header-only mode
# + I've included all files from the FIT SDK cpp dir, but this is
#   probably overkill. I need some way to figure out what is actually
#   being used.
# + CMD check doesn't like *.hpp file extensions, use *.h (e.g with
#   a project-wide find && replace).
