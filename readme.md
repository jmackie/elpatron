**El patr√≥n**. *Spanish*: *the boss*.

This package aims to facilitate cycling data analysis with R. Efficient file reading and support for common (but computationally expensive) calculations are provided. As a companion to this package, I'll try to document various different use cases over on the `gh-pages` branch (*coming soon*). Any contributions to this pseudo-blog are also welcomed.

## Installation

For the latest stable version, install from CRAN:

```
install.packages("elpatron")
```

Or for the development version, install with `devtools`:

```
devtools::install_github("jmackie4/elpatron")
```
