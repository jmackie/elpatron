**El patr√≥n**. *Spanish*: *the boss*. If you aren't familiar with its meaning, this may not be for you...

This package aims to facilitate cycling data analysis with R. Efficient file reading and support for common (but computationally expensive) calculations are provided. As a companion to this package, I'll try to document various different use cases over on the `gh-pages` branch (*coming soon*). Any contributions to this pseudo-blog are also welcomed.

## Installation

For the latest stable version, install from CRAN:

```
install.packages("elpatron")
```

Or for the development version, install with `devtools`:
