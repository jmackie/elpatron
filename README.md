**El patr√≥n**. *Spanish*: *the boss*.

This package aims to facilitate cycling data analysis with `R`. Efficient file reading and support for common (but computationally expensive) calculations are provided. As a companion to this package, I'll try to document various different use cases over on the `gh-pages` branch (*coming soon*).

## Installation

```
devtools::install_github("jmackie4/elpatron")
